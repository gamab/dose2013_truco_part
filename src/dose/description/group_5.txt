The word game Scrabble is a game where players use letter-tiles in order to form words on the gameboard. It is a multiplayer game will support 2-4 players playing against each other. Each user in him/her move needs to try to create word(s) in the board using the letter available in the "rack". Each player will have his/her own rack that will not showed to the other player. Each rack will contain 7 letters randomly choose by the system. In each move the player can use these letters to create the word.
Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.
The game ends when all the tiles run out. The player that get more points win the game.
The online version of the game Scrabble is intended to be part of an game portal, making to users the opportunity to play it on the web.
