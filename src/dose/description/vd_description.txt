Vision Demo
-------------

Created by group: Instructors

This is a small demo to show how Eiffel Vision's 'Model World' can be used to implement games. The Tic-Tac-Toe example relies on using containers as the basic elements to structure the UI. In comparison, the model world is more like drawing on a canvas. In previous years, students reported that they prefer this approach to containers. But it is up to you to choose your preferred way of implementing your game.s

What does the application do: you can drag, move and drop the stones. Their position will be displayed in a separate window.
