The game 7 Wonders is a complex turn based strategy game that revolves around the playing of cards to enhance the city of the player.

At the start of the game, each player is randomly assigned one of the seven wonders of the ancient world around which they must construct their city. Each wonder gives different benefits to the players, such as bonus resources and special abilities. After each player has been assigned a wonder, the game begins. During the game play progresses through three ages of six turns each. At the start of each age, each player is dealt seven cards specific to that age. The total pool of cards for each age changes depending on the number of players so that all cards are dealt at the start of the age. During each turn, all players choose a card to play, then pass their remaining set of cards to the player on their left or right (at the end of the sixth turn the final seventh card is discarded). After every player has played a card, the cards are revealed and their effects take place. Players can also choose not to reveal their chosen card and instead discard it and gain 3 coins, or use it to build a stage of their wonder.

All of the cards that are built give benefits to the player such as providing them with resources or causing various effects to improve their score. Each card also belongs to a particular group that has similar effects on a city.
