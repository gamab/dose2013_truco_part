This exciting family game, for one to six players, is based on actual live stock farming principles.

Squatter (the owner of a large grazing farm) is an Australian sheep farming game. Players start with 3000 sheep, 5 natural pastures and $2,000. Rolling 2 die, players travel around a board of 44 squares. Players aim to upgrade pastures to improved pastures and then to irrigated pastures. Players raise money by selling wool, and buying and selling sheep.

Stud Rams are available for purchase which increases the wool price. Players must deal with drought, floods, fire, disease, vaccinations and other farming expenses.
The winner is the first to raise 6000 sheep on a fully upgraded station.
