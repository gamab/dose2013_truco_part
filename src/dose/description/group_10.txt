Truco, despite simple, is a very exciting and funny card game. Once you learn it, you would keep playing it for hours. What people like more about it is that it is very dynamic and fast paced. You need fast thinking to decide your move, to bluff or to play fair. There are many ways to win and to try to reverse a bad condition.
